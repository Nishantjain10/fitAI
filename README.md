# About FitAi

- FitAi is a web-based fitness application that helps users to stay fit with the help of Artificial Intelligence.

- The goal of this project is to provide a personalized workout plan for each user based on their fitness goals and body type.

<a id="tech"></a>

# Technologies Used

- To create the Frontend, we used next.js & typescript, along with Tailwind CSS for styling.

- For the Backend, we used the services of Appwrite for authentication of the users. The AI algorithms are implemented using Python and TensorFlow.

# How it Works
- The user is introduced to the landing page as soon as he/she opens the website, where we highlight our motive and provide a brief overview of the app.

- To get started, the user must log in/sign up. Once logged in, the user will be asked to select a plan based on their fitness goals (mass gain, fit, weight loss).

- Based on the selected plan, the AI algorithms will provide a personalized workout plan for the user, including the number of sets, reps, and exercises to be performed.

- The user can access their workout plan at any time and track their progress.
